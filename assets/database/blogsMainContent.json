      "content": "<div> <p> <h3>Clean Code</h3> <br> <h6><b>Author: </b>Robert Cecil Martin</h6> <br> <p>Clean Code is a perfect book for software engineers but can also be applicable for data scientists who work primarily in code, especially object-oriented code. My first introduction to this book was at an engineer’s book club in a previous job. Engineers from all different departments got together each week to read a chapter, discuss how it applied to their work, and why they may or may not follow that approach based on the standards set forth by their team. There were many interesting discussions during the book club meetings. These conversations included how teams across the organization looked at coding standards and defined clean code standards within their work scope.</p> <p> By reading this book, you will understand what it means to write bad code and how you can write cleaner code. Each section details how you can transform your code from bad to good, discussing naming, creating functions, objects, and classes. The author also details how to best format your code for maximum readability, which I found most helpful. By the end of the book, he discusses error handling and unit testing that will not obscure the coding logic and aid in test-driven development. Clean Code is, by far, one of my favorite tech books and a must-read. </p> </p>  <p> <h3>An Introduction to Statistical Learning  </h3> <br> <h6><b>Author: </b>Gareth James, Daniela Witten, Trevor Hastie, Robert Tibshirani</h6> <br> <p>As one of the only textbooks I read in my masters, this has been one of my go-to books as it is an excellent guide to statistical learning. This book covers different tools you can use for modeling and understanding your data. I like this book because its practical approach to the problems is targeted towards the end application and not just the mathematical implementations of the algorithms. The book also breaks down the topics using examples in R, allowing the reader to follow along and implement the examples themselves. You will need to understand statistical terms and concepts, but this book is a great reference to have on the shelf.</p> <p> Discussed at the beginning of Statistical Learning are concepts on assessing model accuracy and explaining the different types of machine learning. After reading through the opening chapter, the book gets into different kinds of algorithms are described in more detail, such as linear regression, classification, tree-based models, and support vector machines. However, my favorite chapter is on resampling methods, which gets into more detail on cross-validation and bootstrapping. This chapter has been a great reference on how to use cross-validation with machine learning. I frequently will refer back to this book when looking for some information regarding ML models, and then use it as a stepping stone to determine what information I lack to solve my problem.</p> </p>   <p> <h3>40 Algorithms Every Programmer Should Know </h3> <br> <h6><b>Author: </b>Imran Ahmad </h6> <br> <p> 40 Algorithms is the newest book on my shelf as it discusses standard software algorithms, including machine learning algorithms. This book is a collection of algorithms that cover sorting, searching, graphs, machine learning, NLP, recommendation engines, data, cryptography, and large scale needs. I gravitated towards this book based on its reviews of being a great resource with clearly presented material and Python code snippets. The book’s real-world application examples are a great way to understand how to use these algorithms in practice.</p> <p> The first chapter of this book goes over algorithm design techniques, performance analysis, and validation of an algorithm. After this introduction, the book discusses what different data structures are commonly used within algorithms, which is an excellent refresher if you do not already have a separate book on data structures. The book then breaks down how to design an algorithm with two different examples: the traveling salesman problem and a page-rank problem. Another exciting chapter in this book has discussed practical considerations a developer may make as they develop an algorithm. This chapter looks at the ethics and explainability of the algorithm. All in all, this was a great reference to add to my bookshelf as it discusses computer science algorithms in terms of data science problems.</p> </p> </div>"
